# GeekTooks-Geeklets

This is intended to be a repository of GeekTooks scripts that can be used to make interesting things happen.

It is by no means a complete list, nor is it in any way going to be a well coded or even commented, it is just meant as a place for me to store my own scripts (usually based off of scripts I have found online elsewhere).

I do want to stress the previous point: these scripts are not in any way exclusively mine.  I wrote them a long time ago and I can't remember where I found any of the sources for some of them.
